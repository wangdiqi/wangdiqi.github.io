 resource owner
      An entity capable of granting access to a protected resource.
      When the resource owner is a person, it is referred to as an
      end-user.

   resource server
      The server hosting the protected resources, capable of accepting
      and responding to protected resource requests using access tokens.

   client
      An application making protected resource requests on behalf of the
      resource owner and with its authorization.  The term "client" does
      not imply any particular implementation characteristics (e.g.,
      whether the application executes on a server, a desktop, or other
      devices).

   authorization server
      The server issuing access tokens to the client after successfully
      authenticating the resource owner and obtaining authorization.

(A)  The client requests authorization from the resource owner.  The
     authorization request can be made directly to the resource owner
     (as shown), or preferably indirectly via the authorization
     server as an intermediary.

(B)  The client receives an authorization grant, which is a
     credential representing the resource owner's authorization,
     expressed using one of four grant types defined in this
     specification or using an extension grant type.  The
     authorization grant type depends on the method used by the
     client to request authorization and the types supported by the
     authorization server.

(C)  The client requests an access token by authenticating with the
     authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.

(D)  The authorization server authenticates the client and validates
     the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token.

(E)  The client requests the protected resource from the resource
     server and authenticates by presenting the access token.

(F)  The resource server validates the access token, and if valid,
     serves the request.

#### Authorization Code
与其他三种模式对比，会返回 authorization code
~~~
The authorization code provides a few important security benefits,
such as the ability to authenticate the client, as well as the
transmission of the access token directly to the client without
passing it through the resource owner's user-agent and potentially
exposing it to others, including the resource owner
